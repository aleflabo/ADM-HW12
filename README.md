### Download data of the first semester of 2018
The data that were used to run the analysis are accessible in the [TLC Trip Record Data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) page. That page contains all the data between 2009 and 2018 for yellow, green and FHV taxi. 
Our analysis was focused only in yellow taxi's rides in the first semester(from January to June) of 2018. 
An important part of our study was to find out the main differences between all the Boroughs in New York City. In order to accomplish this task another set of data was necessary, and it can be find in the [taxi zone](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-2018/blob/master/Homework_2/taxi_zone_lookup.csv) file. 

#### Other data
During the analysis we have built up maps that shows differences between the different zones in New York. All the informations, for example the coordinates, about those zones can be find in [this](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-2018/blob/master/Homework_2/taxi_zones.json) file.
